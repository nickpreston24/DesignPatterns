# DesignPatterns

The purpose of this project is to store common and create Design Patterns for use by anyone.

Items to store:
- [X] Full C# implementations of design patterns (e.g. my ISingleton)
- [X] Templated implementations of GOF (Gang of Four) design patterns.
- [X] Custom or WIP DPs like my 'Minion' pattern.
- [ ] Code snippets of any of the above!

Future iterations:
- My goal is to have future iterations hold all of the above items in a similar fashion as this fellow: https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns
